## ‚ú® About The Project

WiFi Direct Cable revolutionizes file sharing by leveraging the power of Wi-Fi Direct. This means you can transfer files, messages, and data between devices without needing a central Wi-Fi network, hotspot, or any internet connection. It establishes a direct, high-speed link between devices, ensuring a transfer process that is not only incredibly fast but also exceptionally stable.

This repository contains the source code for the Android version of the application, built with Flutter.

### üöÄ Biggest Highlight

The core strength of this application is its ability to operate completely offline. By using Wi-Fi Direct, it creates a private network between devices, offering superior speed and reliability compared to other apps that rely on Bluetooth or Wi-Fi hotspots.

### üíª Windows Version

A separate version for Windows is also available, providing the same powerful features for your desktop or laptop. You can find it here: [**Windows Version Repo**](https://github.com/jingcjie/WDCableWUI).

## üåü Features

*   **Direct Device-to-Device Connection**: No need for any intermediary network infrastructure.
*   **High-Speed File Transfer**: Transfer large files in a fraction of the time.
*   **Real-time Messaging**: Chat with another connected device.
*   **Data Streaming**: Send streams of data between devices.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Works on Android, with a separate client for Windows.
*   **Network Speed Test**: Check the transfer speed of your connection.
